    <p>A man sees a scorpion trying to advance in the water. He decides to save him and stretches his finger, but the scorpion stings him. The man tries to save the scorpion from the water again, but the scorpion stings him again. Someone else nearby tells him to stop trying to save the scorpion who is constantly trying to get him in. But the man says: “The sting is inherent in the scorpion. In my nature, there is love. Why would I give up on loving what is my own nature, because sting is inherent in the scorpion?</p>

One day she died. Her death brought him a great sorrow. He finished all her last rites and wanted to leave that town.A man from behind called and said, “Now how will you be able to walk all alone? All these days your wife used to help you”. He replied, “I am not blind. I was acting because if she knew l could see her skin condition due to a disease, it would have pained her more than her disease. I didn’t love her for her beauty alone, but I fell in love with her caring and loving nature. So I pretended to be blind. I only wanted to keep her happy”.</p>
