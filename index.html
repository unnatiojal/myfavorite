        <div class="line"></div>
        <p>I like listening to music because it keeps me calm It makes me happy.it gives emotions.it changes my mood. <br>My favourite kind of musick-pop, pop, hip hop, rhythm & blues, EDM and also I like a little bit jazz, folk,<br>classical and country. Music can also express your<br> emotions without having you show them the way to do <br>it. Music is powerful in many other ways that could<br> take your feelings away. The important thing that the<br> music takes your feelings when you are sad, nervous,<br> or when tour happy also the music makes you happier.
